## GOAL: Create a to-do list that would allow the user to be able to input what they need to complete for the day! Once completed, the user should be able to check them off and have the ability to delete them as well!

Feel free to clone and use this code however you see fit! Make sure to have npm, node, express, and mongoDB installed on your computer/terminal in order to 
run this code correctly! The server port number will be displayed in the terminal after you run server.js!
